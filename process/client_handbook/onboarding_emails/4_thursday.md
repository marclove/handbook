An Introduction to User Stories

[EMAIL BODY]

##User Stories 101: Planning Development Work

When we kick off your project, we'll work together to identify user stories. These are the things people who use your software want to do. They often look like this:

    As a retail customer
    I want to enter my credit card information
    So that I can buy a shirt

Once this story is understood by the team (product owner, designer, and developers), the development work begins. Then we'll work together to test and refine the feature.

Often one user story leads to another: What should we do when a user's credit card expires? Do we want users to be able to enter a back-up credit card?

We'll balance these questions with the overall goal of the software to identify the most important thing to build next.

Sincerely,
