# Work Leaves

Taking time off can affect Gaslight's cash flow, project schedules,
and client expectations, so we appreciate being informed as far ahead as
possible. For planned time off (vacation, parental leave, etc.), thirty
days would be best.

Of course, things happen that cause us to miss a day here or there.  We
understand this, so just let the Guide know as soon as possible. We use
the same procedure for these days.

Communicate with your team and the Guide about the leave you will be
taking. The Guide will help with scheduling a replacement and/or working
with the client.

## During a Leave

### Medical Insurance

Unless otherwise stated, and to the extent allowed by the insurance
contract, we will continue to provide medical insurance coverage during
your leave. During this time, you will be responsible for paying the
monthly premium(s) for your coverage.

### Benefits/Reviews

Unless otherwise stated, your benefits will not continue to accrue, and
you will not receive quarterly reviews during the period of leave.

### Other Employment

While on leave, employees may not accept other employment. Acceptance of
other employment while on leave will be treated as a voluntary
resignation from employment.

## Paid Time Off

Our time off policy is that employees can use their own judgment when taking
time off and there will not be a set limit of time off that must be adhered to.

Coordinate with the Project Guide and your team to figure out whether
some time you want to take off makes sense.

### Eligibility

Salaried employees are eligible for paid time off, which can be used for
sick, personal and vacation time.

Co-Ops are eligible for paid time off as well, but time off should be
limited due to the abbreviated time in the program.

### How it works

The following is the process to obtain approval for scheduled time off.

#### What You Do

1. Email your Request

  Send an email to [timeoff@gaslight.co][timeoff] with the requested
  dates of your leave.  This is to let the Guide know about your
  request. This is important because we need to make sure the project is
  covered and the Guide is responsible for scheduling.

  Include:

  * Start and end date
  * Optional, but may be used to determine priority: Reason for leave

#### What the Guide Does

1. Approve or Deny the Request

  We'll take project load, other requests, etc. in to account during the
  process. We need to make sure we can cover all of our work.

1. Update the Schedule

  Once you've identified the time you'll be taking off and it's
  approved, adjust the weekly schedule on the [Gaslight App][scheduler]
  to include the time off.

1. Notifies the appropriate teams

  Email [gaslighters@googlegroups.com][gaslighters] and make sure the
  rest of the team and clients know you'll be off.

1. Updates the time tracker

  We want to make sure everyone is taking enough leave, so we track time
  taken.

When possible, time off requests are granted, taking into account operating
requirements. If there is an issue granting everyone's time off, length of
employment may determine priority in scheduling time off. Requests may
also be based on reason for the leave. For example, parental leave may
take precedence over a vacation.

If you must take an extended period of time off (more than 15 out of 20
business days) this is a special case and requires approval from both
the Guide and the Managing Partner.

## Parental Leave

Note: Currently, [FMLA][fmla] doesn't apply to our company as we're
under the employee limit. We've outlined our parental leave policy
below.

Employees are eligible for a leave of absence without pay upon the birth
or adoption of a child. Such leave may begin up to six months after of
the birth or adoption of the child. Paid time off can be used
concurrently with this leave.

Employees seeking parental leave must provide a minimum of 30 days
advance notice of their intent to take parental leave and the
anticipated date of their return.

The company will continue to fully contribute to insurance premiums per
company policy for up to 6 months.

## Medical Leave

Employees are eligible for an unpaid medical leave due to
non-occupational illness, injury or pregnancy-related disability.

Employees requesting leave must provide written notice of the
disability, including a doctor's certificate stating the nature of the
disability and the expected date of return to work. When you are able to
return to work, give us at least one week's advance written notice.
Include a doctor's certificate stating that you are medically able to
return to your normal duties.

The company will continue to fully contribute to insurance premiums per
company policy for up to 6 months.

## Military Leave

Employees who are required to fulfill military obligations in any branch
of the Armed Forces of the United States or in state military service
will be given the necessary time off and reinstated in accordance with
federal and state law.

The time off will be unpaid, except where state law dictates otherwise.
Exempt employees may be provided time off with pay when necessary to
comply with state and federal wage and hour laws.

Military orders should be presented to the management and arrangements
for leave made as early as possible before departure. Employees are
required to give advance notice of their service obligations to the
company unless military necessity makes this impossible. You must
notify the management of your intent to return to employment based on
requirements of the law. Your benefits may continue to accrue during
the period of leave in accordance with state and federal law.

## Jury Duty

Any employee who is requested to perform service as a juror shall be
given unpaid time off while serving on the jury. Paid time off can also
be used concurrently with this leave.

## Leave of Absence

Under special circumstances, full-time and part-time regular employees
may be granted a leave of absence without pay. The granting of this type
of leave is normally for compelling reasons and is dependent upon the
written approval of the managing partner.
