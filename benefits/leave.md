# Work Leaves

The foundation of all of our leave policies is our paid time off policy.

Taking time off can affect Gaslight’s cash flow, project schedules,
and client expectations, so we appreciate being informed as far ahead as
possible.

Communicate with your team, clients, and management about the leave you
will be taking.

## During a Leave

### Medical Insurance

Unless otherwise stated, and to the extent allowed by the insurance
contract, we will continue to provide medical insurance coverage during
your leave. During this time, you will be responsible for paying the
monthly premium(s) for your coverage.

### Benefits/Reviews

Unless otherwise stated, your benefits will not continue to accrue, and
you will not receive quarterly reviews during the period of leave.

### Other Employment

While on leave, employees may not accept other employment or apply for
unemployment insurance. Acceptance of other employment while on leave
will be treated as a voluntary resignation from employment.

## Paid Time Off

Our time off policy is that employees can use their own judgment when taking
time off and there will not be a set limit of time off that must be adhered to.

Taking time off can affect Gaslight’s cash flow, project schedules, and
client expectations, so we appreciate being informed as far ahead as possible.

Use your best judgement and coordinate with the Project Guide, your team, and
client, to figure out whether some time you want to take off makes sense.

### How it works

1. Talk with the Guide

  Let the Guide know about your request. This is important because we
  need to make sure the project is covered and the Guide is responsible
  for scheduling.

1. Update the Schedule

  Once you’ve identified the time you’ll be taking off and it's
  approved, adjust the weekly schedule on the [Gaslight App][scheduler]
  to include the time off.

1. Email the Team and Client

  Email gaslighters@googlegroups.com and make sure the rest of the team and
  clients know you’ll be off.

When possible, time off requests are granted, taking into account operating
requirements. If there is an issue granting everyone’s time off, length of
employment may determine priority in scheduling time off.

If you must take an extended period of time off (more than 15 out of 20
business days) this is considered a leave of absence and will fall under the
appropriate leave of absence policy.

### Eligibility

Salaried employees are eligible for paid time off, which can be used for
sick, personal and vacation time.

Co-Ops are eligible for paid time off as well, but time off should be
limited due to the abbreviated time in the program.

## Parental Leave

Employees are eligible for a leave of absence without pay upon the birth
or adoption of a child. Such leave may begin up to six months after of
the birth or adoption of the child.

Employees seeking parental leave must provide a minimum of 30 days
advance notice of their intent to take parental leave and the
anticipated date of their return.

The company will continue to fully contribute to insurance premiums per
company policy for up to 6 months.

## Disability Leave

Employees are eligible for an unpaid disability leave due to
non-occupational illness, injury or pregnancy-related disability.

Employees requesting leave must provide written notice of the
disability, including a doctor’s certificate stating the nature of the
disability and the expected date of return to work. When you are able to
return to work, give us at least one week’s advance written notice.
Include a doctor’s certificate stating that you are medically able to
return to your normal duties.

The company will continue to fully contribute to insurance premiums per
company policy for up to 6 months.

## Military Leave

Employees who are required to fulfill military obligations in any branch
of the Armed Forces of the United States or in state military service
will be given the necessary time off and reinstated in accordance with
federal and state law.

The time off will be unpaid, except where state law dictates otherwise.
Exempt employees may be provided time off with pay when necessary to
comply with state and federal wage and hour laws.

Military orders should be presented to the management and arrangements
for leave made as early as possible before departure. Employees are
required to give advance notice of their service obligations to the
company unless military necessity makes this impossible. You must
notify the management of your intent to return to employment based on
requirements of the law. Your benefits may continue to accrue during
the period of leave in accordance with state and federal law.

## Jury Duty

Any employee who is requested to perform service as a juror shall be
given unpaid time off while serving on the jury.

## Leave of Absence

Under special circumstances, full-time and part-time regular employees
may be granted a leave of absence without pay. The granting of this type
of leave is normally for compelling reasons and is dependent upon the
written approval of the president.
