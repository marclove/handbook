# Communication at Gaslight

We use a few different methods to share ideas, let everyone know something's going on or just hang out and chat.

## Email

Email is still the most common method of communication. Everyone knows how to use email. We've set up a few kinds of groups to easily stay up to date. Everyone at Gaslight is made a groups admin so that you can add/remove yourself to lists or topics you're currently working on or interested in.

#### Announcements/Notifications

You can send an email to gaslighters@googlegroups.com to reach everyone. Try to keep traffic here to a minimum. This is a good way to announce something to the whole team, raise an issue that everyone needs to be made aware of, or invite everyone to an event.

#### Per Project Mailing Lists

We set up a mailing list for each project. We add clients, Gaslighters and any relevant third parties to the project list. This is a great way to make sure everyone who needs to know something about a project stays up to date.

#### Internal Mailing Lists

There are a few internal lists as well. For example, there's a mailing list for our Book Club. If you're interested in participating in the book club discussions, just join that group.

## Talk

We have a Discourse instance set up at http://talk.gaslight.co. We use it to have long-running asynchronous discussions. Examples of good topics for Talk thread include things like process improvement ideas, how we do peer reviews, or discussion around a relevant blog post or video.

## Slack

Slack allows us to create asynchronous chat rooms for many topics. We use it for client projects, internal projects, internal company wide chat and even community chat. You can sign up with your gaslight.co or teamgaslight.com email address at https://gaslight.slack.com. There are great native apps for Mac, iOS, Android as well as a web application.

## Face to Face

This is the preferred (though not always possible) method of communication. Sometimes it's difficult to convey a message with text alone. Face to face allows us to emphasize words, talk through an idea or resolve differences faster than any other medium.

If you have a face to face conversation and believe the outcome could be relevant to others on the team, please write up a quick summary and post it to one of the other channels available.

## Video

Video is the best way to have __almost__ face to face meetings with remote team members or clients. We like services like https://talky.io and Google Hangounts for these types of communication.

## Shared Calendar

We have a shared Google calendar available to everyone. It's important to keep the content relevant to everyone here. Company holidays, individual days off, company wide events and meetings are all good things to add to the shared calendar. Avoid project specific things here.

If you don't have access to the shared calendar, you can ask anyone to add you. Here's how to do that:

1. Visit https://calendar.gaslight.co/
2. Click the little settings arrow next to the "Gaslight - Shared" calendar in the sidebar.
3. Click "Share this Calendar"
4. Enter their Gaslight email address and allow them to manage sharing also.
5. Click the "Save" button at the bottom of the list. Don't forget this one.
