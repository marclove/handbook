# Our Values

## Shared Purpose

> Gaslight exists to inspire creators to learn, build and share great
things with our community.

## History

In 2009, a few independent developers decided to stop being so, well,
independent. We liked writing code and solving problems for our clients,
but we didn't like doing it alone. Some of us enjoyed the sales process,
while others weren't as interested. We wanted a place to share and grow
with our larger community as well. So, Gaslight was born.

Initially, we were still very independent within the group. An
individual would land a project, ask someone to pair and split the
income. Everyone contributed to the monthly overhead. It was the
beginning of our team.

As we grew and took on more projects, we made the decision to switch
from independent contractors to employees and to create a more
traditional company structure.

### Why the Switch?

We found that we were hitting limitations as individuals and the only
way to take things to the next level was to share and trust more of each
other. As an individual, you can budget, save and plan to take time off.
We wanted to create something larger than each of us. Something we could
use to propel us to the places we wanted to go in order to grow the
number of developers, teach people new skills or grow and contribute to
our community.

## Learning

Learning is critical in order for our business to thrive. We want to
solve problems the best way we know how, and we want to stay on top of
the trends and best practices. We encourage learning by making it
intentional.

We give our people time dedicated to learning and growing. We send them
to conferences, training classes and by keeping a library.

## Building

We solve problems. We solve problems for our clients, for our community
and for ourselves. Of the three values, building is where the learning
goes in to action.

Currently, one of the core functions of building is our consulting
service. We want to solve hard problems for our clients, making them
more competitive and, therefore, earning more income. We want to be
aware of the value we're adding. We want to be a trusted partner, not
just a service provider.

We're always working toward those goals of communication, trust and
value. We want clients who are interested in the same.

## Sharing

Sharing things that we've learned is important, as we've all grown from
the kindness of others. We want to actively share what we're learning,
things that have benefited us and lessons learned from projects and
experiments.

All the tools we use at Gaslight are Open Source, so we want to
contribute as much as we can to improve those tools. We consider our
contributions to Open Source sharing.

We're teachers. We want to share what we've learned with our community.
We do that by teaching workshops in person and online, by blogging and
podcasting and by participating and hosting user groups.
