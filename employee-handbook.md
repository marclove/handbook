## Communications and Operations

### Weekly All Hands Meeting

Once a week on Mondays, we order lunch for the team and have our team
meeting. The goal for this meeting is to ensure we're all focusing on
the same efforts and that we're moving forward as a team.

We follow an agenda to keep things focused and on schedule. The agenda
is as follows:

* Lows and Highs

  Each of us talks about our individual low and high for the past week.
  It can be anything &emdash; work or personal or both.
* Client Health

  A recap by the [Guide](roles/guide-role.md) of the health of the
  projects on the schedule. The goal is to get the entire team up to
  speed about wins and potential trouble spots.
* Podcast

  [Mitch](@mitchlloyd) updates everyone on prior episode analytics,
  upcoming guests and needs. Guest and topic ideas are also proposed.
* Blog

  [Joel](@joelturnbull) is currently serving as blog editor. He reviews
  analytics, talks about posts that performed well over the past week
  and reviews the status of upcoming posts.
* [Thunder Thursday](#thunder-thursday) Speakers

  We line up the [Thunder Thursday](#thunder-thursday) speakers for the
  week. Once chosen, the fridge magnets are updated.

### Thunder Thursday

On Thursdays at 12:30pm, we all gather in the comfy couch area for three
quick talks. The talks are about anything you've learned or are
learning, something you think is helpful to the rest of the team, or any
combination of the above. We want to encourage learning and these talks
are a quick way for us to learn and share.

Speakers are chosen during the Monday meeting. Once chosen, the fridge
magnets are updated to reflect the speakers for the week. The goal is
that we rotate through everyone and that everyone speaks about something
to the rest of the group.
