# Expenses

We will make every effort to reimburse approved expenses as quickly as
possible. Our goal is to make this process as painless as possible.

To that end, we use [Expensify](http://expensify.com) to both capture
expenses and submit expense reports.

If you are not part of Team Gaslight Expensify then let our administrator know (Chris M.) can send you an invite.

If you install the Expensify iPhone app, you can take photos of
receipts at time of purchase. You do not need to retain the paper
receipt. Having the photo is enough. All expenses need to be
classified in Expensify by the purchaser before submitting them for
reimbursement. 

If it is an expense that is billable to the client mark is as “billable”,  if not mark it as “reimbursable”. A billable expense would be for example the amount the Sharethrough team accrued with their meals and transit while in S.F. that is then billed back to the client. Please use your best judgement here! If you would feel uncomfortable billing them for a certain expense directly then don't mark it as billable. 

Group expenses together into an expense report and submit them through the Expensify web site.

Our accounting department is now using [Bill.com](http://app.bill.com) to direct deposit expense checks into your bank account. You can choose to still receive a paper check be sent by mail.

At this point, if you have never been paid through bill.com you will receive an invitation from bill.com via our Accountant, Christie Cockett at AccountingDepartment.com.  Follow the instructions in the invite.

Once Christie processes the bill, which she does daily, Chris is sent a notice through bill.com that states there is a bill that needs paid.  Once Chris pays this it takes 2 business days for it to show up in your account.  

The entire process shouldn’t take any more than 3-4 business days.

## Dates

It's important that we close our books in a timely manner, so expenses
for the prior month need to be submitted within three business days of
previous month.
