Wednesday - Our Process
=======================

Let's Talk Kanban
-----------------

In preparation for our project kick-off next week, we want to let you know a
little bit about our process.

We believe that our process for developing software gives us an edge. This
process is built on the principles of the Kanban manufacturing process. We
emphasise:

* Small teams
* A visual representation of work on a Kanban board
* Limiting work in progress
* Continuous feedback on the product and process

We use a web tool called [Trello](https://trello.com/) that serves as our
digital Kanban board. We'll cover more about the details of how we use it once
the project starts, but for now you may want to get a head start by signing up
for an account (it's free!).

The life of a User Story
------------------------

We will divide the project into units of work that we call User Stories. Each
one of these stories represents something that a user of a system wants to do.
Often they are written in a format like this:

    As a retail customer
    I want to enter my credit card information
    So that I can buy a shirt

Once this story is understood by team (product owner, designer, and developers),
the development team begins working on the software. When this functionality is
ready, the story is "Ready for Acceptance". The product owner will use the
software to act out the user story and make sure that it accomplishes the
intended goal. If it works, then the story is accepted and development
continues.

Inevitably there are other things that come to mind when accepting a feature.
What should we do when the user's credit card expires?  Wouldn't it be nice if
the user could enter a backup credit card in case one is declined?  While each
story may require some back and forth before it is accepted, it is important to
keep the overall goal of the software in mind. We often ask: "What is the next
most important thing to work on?" in order to refocus on the vision of the
product and make sure we're not spending too much time on details at the expense
of more critical features.

Milestones
----------

At a higher level, we'll also create milestones for the project. A milestone
represents a set of deliverable features that can be tested with users or used
in a demo. Milestones help the team see the forest through the trees and keep
the vision of the product in mind.
