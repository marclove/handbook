# About Gaslight

## Shared Purpose

> Gaslight exists to inspire creators to learn, build and share great
things with our community.

### History

In 2009, a few independent developers decided to stop being so, well,
independent. We liked writing code and solving problems for our clients,
but we didn't like doing it alone. Some of us enjoyed the sales process,
while others weren't as interested. We wanted a place to share and grow
with our larger community as well. So, Gaslight was born.

Initially, we were still very independent within the group. An
individual would land a project, ask someone to pair and split the
income. Everyone contributed to the monthly overhead. It was the
beginning of our team.

As we grew and took on more projects, we made the decision to switch
from independent contractors to employees and to create a more
traditional company structure.

#### Why the Switch?

We found that we were hitting limitations as individuals and the only
way to take things to the next level was to share and trust more of each
other. As an individual, you can budget, save and plan to take time off.
We wanted to create something larger than each of us. Something we could
use to propel us to the places we wanted to go in order to grow the
number of developers, teach people new skills or grow and contribute to
our community.

## Learning

Learning is critical in order for our business to thrive. We want to
solve problems the best way we know how, and we want to stay on top of
the trends and best practices. In fact, we'd like to drive these things
instead of just keeping up with others around us. We do this by investing in
learning. We also value learning because curiousity and discovery are things
we want to encourage. We encourage learning by making it intentional.

We give our people time dedicated to learning and growing. We send them
to conferences, training classes and by keeping a library.

## Building

We solve problems. We solve problems for our clients, for our community
and for ourselves. Of the three values, building is where the learning
goes in to action.

Currently, one of the core functions of building is our consulting
service. We want to solve hard problems for our clients, making them
more competitive and, therefore, earning more income. We want to be
aware of the value we're adding. We want to be a trusted partner, not
just a service provider.

We're always working toward those goals of communication, trust and
value. We want clients who are interested in the same.

We also dedicate company time to building internal tools. At times, we may
also work on products that we may have intentions of selling. Lastly, we also
build things that are beneficial for the community.

## Sharing

Sharing things that we've learned is important, as we've all grown from
the kindness of others. We want to actively share what we're learning,
things that have benefited us and lessons learned from projects and
experiments.

All the tools we use at Gaslight are Open Source, so we want to
contribute as much as we can to improve those tools. We consider our
contributions to Open Source sharing.

We're teachers. We want to share what we've learned with our community.
We do that by teaching workshops in person and online, by blogging and
podcasting and by participating and hosting user groups.

## Balance between the three

Learning, building, and sharing each have value. However, they are of limited
value in isolation. Spending a week learning about the newest technologies or
agile theory is really only valuable if it is applied when building something,
or when shared with others. If all time is spent building solutions for
clients, our skills may stagnate. If we don't have knowledge or
haven't built something of value, we will have nothing to share. In short,
every action we participate in will likely include some level of learning,
building, and sharing. If a proposed action doesn't involve most or all of
these three, it probably isn't something that we should do, or spend much time
on.

## Values

### Transparency

We share most financial information within the company. We let our clients know what is going on. We default to honesty. We don't value creating secrets. Although it may require a special request, anyone who wants information can usually get it by asking others. Very few questions are off limits.

### Sustainable Work

We value a comfortable work environment and a comfortable working pace. We discourage short-cuts today that will be expensive tomorrow. We do not work long hours to meet deadlines. We believe in moving projects forward at a steady pace over attempting large, risky jumps.

### Autonomy

We empower Gaslighters with information so that they can act autonomously. We let people know the intent and the vision of the company and let them decide how to execute. We expect people to be autonomous and we cultivate that autonomy. We support and value people's autonomous efforts. Speaking at conferences, writing open source tools, writing articles, educating themselves and honing their skills, examining and honing our process etc. When I think about accountability, I think about it in the scope of these autonomous efforts[

These ideas are taken directly from a talk that @cdmwebs played when he talked about becoming the CEO:

Here are some concept form the talk and David Marqet's website:

* Give control, don’t take control. 
* Create technical competence in the workplace. 
* Be honest, public, and clear about the organization’s goals.
* Move authority to where the information is.
* Give the Benefit of the Doubt

Best summarized from the prime directive that Doug linked to for our retrospectives:

> We assume that everyone did the best job they could, given what they 
> knew at the time, their skills and abilities, the resources available, 
> and the situation at hand.

### Focus On Process

We value the process we have developed for working on projects. We continually look for ways to improve our process and share these ideas with our clients.

### Pay it Forward

This is how I would best describe our community involvement. We pay forward our knowledge and our successes, because there is value in cultivating the success of those who are hungry for it like we are, and value in being a part of that success. Especially on a local level.

### Humility

No matter how well we do, we can always be better.
