# Continuous Integration

We use [CodeShip](http://codeship.io) for continuous integration. Use
codeship@gaslight.co (credentials in the Accounts Google Doc) to setup your
project. You can add Team Members in order to give everyone the project access.

## **REMEMBER**

You have to set up the project under this account then invite yourself and other team members to it. This is the only paid account.
