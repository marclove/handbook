## Insurance Information

### Health Insurance

Our health insurance provider is United Health Care. Our plan is managed by [BW Employee Benefits](http://www.bwebenefits.com/).

Currently, we offer two plans: a High Deductible HSA plan and a traditional PPO.

Benefits are effective 30 days from your hire date.

#### Health Savings Accounts

If you choose the HDHP, you can open a [health savings account](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_savings_account) with your bank and have funds directly deposited every pay period. The funds are pre-tax.

To enroll, you'll need to email [Cyndee](mailto:CD@echoiceplus.com) at Employer's Choice Plus with the following information:
