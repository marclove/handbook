# Hiring

Right now, we're using Trello to manage the process of hiring. 

## Hiring Need

What does it mean to say that "we're hiring"? Three things:

1. Position (developer/designer/training director/etc)
1. Specific skills/experience level
1. Target Start Date

## Cards

Cards representing people should contain the following:

1. Name
1. Source
1. Personal context
1. Picture
1. Attached Resume and cover letter
1. Personal contact info
1. github/portfolio links
1. a label corresponding to the position

## Lists

Lists in Trello have a card at the top to indicate what the column means. It's important that candidates don't spend too long in any one list. Guidelines are listed below under 'Process'.

## Ownership

When a hiring need is identified, an owner for that hiring need is appointed. A column and [wip] number should indicate the number of positions for that role we're hiring. We don't have a great way to designate the hiring need owner, but for now we're just adding that info the list title. Sometimes, the owner delegates activities (such as pairing) to someone else. That person should be added to the specific card and their required action should be communicated and confirmed. When their involvement is over, they can be removed from the card.

## Process

We require that all candidates officially apply for the position through the website. We often encourage candidates to apply, but we still want them to take the action of applying. People that we're "recruiting" to apply are placed in the "People we want to apply" list. When candidates apply through the website, Zapier places them in the 'Inbox for Review' list. They should be responded to within a day. We don't want to leave people hanging. As people move through the process, we should minimize the feedback loop time for response. This should be indicated through due dates on the card. In addition, when activities are scheduled, we should make note of the activity and have a due date representing that activity. The person responsible for that activity is held accountable for making sure the activity occurrs on time.

## Activities

As described above, activities should be clearly understood and assigned and communicated with a due date and assigned person. Once the activity is over, a summary of that activity should be recorded on the card. Someone looking at the card should have a general idea as to the current opinion of that particular person. Of course, the comments should be stated in a way that would be acceptable for them to read if they were hired, as they'll be able to view the board.

## Decisions

If we or the candidate declines to progress further in the hiring process, they should be moved either to the 'They Passed' or 'We Passed' lists. If they are determined to not be worthy of a screening or second interview, it may make sense to move them to 'Recruiting Contact' instead. This process is a little fuzzy right now. If they are hired, they should be moved to the specific role need list and the list details should be updated.

## Offers

Right now, we're delegating some parts of the actual offer to @cdmwebs. Collaborate with him as needed.

## Hiring

Once an offer has been made and that person accepts, they're officially hired. At this point, onboarding can occurr. The person responsible for onboarding should be introduced to the hiree so the onboarding process can be followed precisely.
