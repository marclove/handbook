[FAQS FOR WEBSITE]

**What happens if one of my team members goes on vacation?**  
If one of your team members takes vacation days or other time off during your project, we'll fill that roll with another designer or developer. Our tight-knit company makes these transitions seamless.

**On which holidays is Gaslight closed?**  
Gaslight is closed on these national holidays: New Year's Day, Memorial Day, Fourth of July, Labor Day and Thanksgiving. Typically, we also close the week from Christmas through New Year's Day.

**Are you ever out for company wide meetings or retreats?**  
Occasionally, we have company wide meetings or retreats. We'll provide one to two week's notice if one of these events happens during your project.

**Will my Gaslight team remain the same throughout my project?**  
Sometimes we'll make a change to your project team. Often it's to fill a specific technology need or expertise area. After a major milestone, we might rotate in a new team member to add a fresh perspective.
