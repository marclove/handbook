## Inspiration

Lots of companies have handbooks, but a few of them make them publicly
available. We were motivated to do the same by these fine folks:

* [dojo4](http://https://github.com/dojo4/policy)
* [thoughtbot](https://github.com/thoughtbot/guides)
* [Valve](http://www.valvesoftware.com/)

We're also interested in [B Corporations](http://www.bcorporation.net/).
We took quite a bit of inspiration from there, also.
