# Time Off and Work Leave

Research shows that the more people work, the less productive they become without the proper amount of time to recharge.

Being sensetive to the personal well-being of each individual at Gaslight is as much a part of our culture as is how we deliver value to our clients. Not only is time-off promoted, it's required.

It's also recognized in addition to personal well-being, taking time off can affect Gaslight's cash flow, project schedules,
and client expectations, so we having a well formed policy for taking time off is very important for all.

## Paid Time Off (PTO)

Our PTO policy requires each team member take at minimum 2 weeks off each year with a maximum time off of 4 weeks. Sick time is excluded from this time off policy.


### Eligibility

Salaried employees are eligible for paid time off, which can be used for personal and vacation time.

Co-Ops are eligible for limited paid time off, which can be used for sick or personal time. 
Due to the co-op program not being a full-time salaried employee position, paid time-off 
requests will be approved on a case by case basis.

### How it works

The following is the process to obtain approval for scheduled time off.

#### What You Do

1. Email your Request

  Send an email to [timeoff@gaslight.co][timeoff] with the requested
  dates of your leave.

  Include:

  * Start and end date
  * Optional, but may be used to determine priority: Reason for leave
  * 1 to 2 day requests require 1 week notice
  * 3+ days require 2 weeks notice

#### The Approval Process

1. Approve or Deny the Request

  We'll take project load, other requests, etc. in to account during the
  process. We need to make sure we can cover all of our work. The COO makes final decisions for time off requests.

1. Update the Schedule

  Once you've identified the time you'll be taking off and it's
  approved, adjust the weekly schedule on the [Gaslight App][scheduler]
  to include the time off.

1. Notifies the appropriate teams

  Email [gaslighters@googlegroups.com][gaslighters] and make sure the
  rest of the team and clients know you'll be off.

1. Updates the time tracker

  We want to make sure everyone is taking at least the minimum leave, so we track time
  taken.

When possible, time off requests are granted, taking into account operating
requirements. If there is an issue granting everyone's time off, length of
employment may determine priority in scheduling time off. Requests may
also be based on reason for the leave. For example, parental leave may
take precedence over a vacation.

If you request an extended period of time off (more than 10 business days) this is a special case and requires approval from both the Guide and COO.

## Extended Leave of Absence

Under special circumstances, full-time and part-time regular employees
may be granted a leave of absence without pay. The granting of this type
of leave is normally for compelling reasons and is dependent upon the
written approval of the COO.

### Medical Insurance

Unless otherwise stated, and to the extent allowed by the insurance
contract, we will continue to provide medical insurance coverage during
your leave. During this time, you will be responsible for paying the
monthly premium(s) for your coverage.

### Other Employment

While on leave, employees may not accept other employment. Acceptance of
other employment while on leave will be treated as a voluntary
resignation from employment.


### Parental Leave

Note: Currently, [FMLA][fmla] doesn't apply to our company as we're
under the [50 employees within 75 miles limit](http://www.dol.gov/whd/regs/compliance/whdfs28.htm). We've outlined our parental leave policy
below.

Employees are eligible for a leave of absence without pay upon the birth
or adoption of a child. Such leave may begin up to six months after of
the birth or adoption of the child. Paid time off can be used
concurrently with this leave.

Employees seeking parental leave must provide a minimum of 30 days
advance notice of their intent to take parental leave and the
anticipated date of their return.

The company will continue to fully contribute to insurance premiums per
company policy for up to 6 months.

### Medical Leave

Employees are eligible for an unpaid medical leave due to
non-occupational illness, injury or pregnancy-related disability.

Employees requesting leave must provide written notice of the
disability, including a doctor's certificate stating the nature of the
disability and the expected date of return to work. When you are able to
return to work, give us at least one week's advance written notice.
Include a doctor's certificate stating that you are medically able to
return to your normal duties.

The company will continue to fully contribute to insurance premiums per
company policy for up to 6 months.

### Military Leave

Employees who are required to fulfill military obligations in any branch
of the Armed Forces of the United States or in state military service
will be given the necessary time off and reinstated in accordance with
federal and state law.

The time off will be unpaid, except where state law dictates otherwise.
Exempt employees may be provided time off with pay when necessary to
comply with state and federal wage and hour laws.

Military orders should be presented to the management and arrangements
for leave made as early as possible before departure. Employees are
required to give advance notice of their service obligations to the
company unless military necessity makes this impossible. You must
notify the management of your intent to return to employment based on
requirements of the law. Your benefits may continue to accrue during
the period of leave in accordance with state and federal law.

### Jury Duty

Any employee who is requested to perform service as a juror shall be
given unpaid time off while serving on the jury. Paid time off can also
be used concurrently with this leave.
