[SUBJECT LINE] How We Collaborate With Clients

[BODY]

##We're All on the Same Team

We believe clients play an integral role on our small project teams. In fact, we love it when clients come into the office and work side-by-side with us. Here's what to expect when we kick-off your project:

**Daily Stand-Ups**  
We meet with the product owner (that's you) on a daily basis. We call these short meetings stand-ups, and they often happen over the phone.

**Weekly Check-In Meeting**  
Once a week we'll hold a longer check-in meeting to discuss big picture items, from process to priorities.

**Project Management Software**  
We use a free Web tool called [Trello](https://trello.com/) to manage work. You can get a head start now by creating a free account: [Sign up for Trello.](https://trello.com/signup)

When we kick of your project next week, we'll walk you through each of these items in more detail.

Sincerely,  
Peter Kananen
