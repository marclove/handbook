# Expenses

We will make every effort to reimburse approved expenses as quickly as
possible. Our goal is to make this process as painless as possible.

To that end, we use [Expensify](http://expensify.com) to both capture
expenses and submit expense reports.

If you install the Expensify iPhone app, you can take photos of
receipts at time of purchase. You do not need to retain the paper
receipt. Having the photo is enough. All expenses need to be
classified in Expensify by the purchaser before submitting them for
reimbursement.

Group expenses together into an expense report and submit them through the Expensify web site.

Our accounting department is now using [Bill.com](http://app.bill.com) to direct deposit expense checks into your bank account. You can choose to still receive a paper check be sent by mail.

## Dates

It's important that we close our books in a timely manner, so expenses
for the prior month need to be submitted within three business days of
previous month.
