Tuesday - Project Events
========================

* How we handle vacation and time off for team members
------------------------------------------------------
When a Gaslight team member will be out for vacation or other time off, we
backfill with another developer or designer from the Gaslight team. Because we
work closely as a team, often pair programming, this substitution is quite
seamless. In addition, it is often the case that a new member of team brings an
objective viewpoint and a fresh set of the eyes to the application.

* Non-working Holidays
----------------------
The Gaslight office is closed on New Year's Day, Memorial Day, 4th of July,
Labor Day, Thanksgiving, and the week between Christmas and New Year's (as a
general rule). We also occasionally have company wide meetings or retreats.
We'll provide notice one to two weeks of notice for these events.

* Why we may rotate people on the project
-----------------------------------------
Ocassionally, we may make permanent changes to the Gaslight team on the
project. We do this for several different reasons. We may rotate someone on a
project to fill a specific technology need or with specific domain expertise.
We also rotate people after we've achieved a milestone on the project and we
think it's time for a new perspective through a new team member.
