[SUBJECT LINE] How We Deliver Value: Agile 101

[EMAIL BODY]

##Introducing Agile Software Development

Gaslight follows an agile development process. At its most basic, this means we're flexible. We re-priortize what we're going to build next as we learn more about your business and the software we're building together.

Instead of being stuck with a fixed upfront plan, this approach allows us to focus on creating features that deliver the most value to your business. Things that boosts your profits, increase productivity or create an entirely new revenue stream.

Upfront plans always evolve as the team learns more about the problem we're trying to solve. We might discover a critical new feature to build or learn that another feature isn't as important as we first thought.

We embrace this process by:

* **Launching early and often:** We launch new software features as often as possible, so we can test and refine them.  

* **Constantly reassessing priorities:** To deliver the most value, we take a look each week at what's most important to build next.

* **Daily communication:** We have quick meetings each day, so the whole team stays on track (more on this in tomorrow's email).

We look forward to working through this process to deliver value for your company.

Sincerely,  
Peter Kananen
