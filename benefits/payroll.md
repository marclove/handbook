## Accessing the payroll system

* Visit http://www.cyberpayonline.com/ecp/payreview.php
* Select "Create Login"
* Follow the steps
* Employer ID is G02E

You will also need the net pay of one of your paychecks during the
signup process.  I suggest you get that by logging into your home
banking system and getting the check date and amount.
