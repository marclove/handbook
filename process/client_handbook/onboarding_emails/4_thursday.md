Thursday - Client Engagement
============================

Waterfall Development
---------------------

Our most successful projects at Gaslight have very engaged clients. To
understand what it looks like when a client is engaged in the development
processes, we need to understand the opposite: a "waterfall" or "over the wall"
approach to development.

Historically software development has been characterized by a series of
sequential steps now referred to as "waterfall". Someone defines all the
requirements, someone creates the entire system, and someone tests that system.
The idea is simple: The business knows what it wants and the engineers know how
to build it.

Agile Development
-----------------

Unfortunately it is not realistic to expect someone to create complete
requirements for any significant software project, no matter how much experience
they have. As software is built the scope and direction inevitably changes.

Requirements always change because every day the team understands the problem
better than the day before. They may learn about a new critical feature that
must be added or they may find that a key feature is no longer important.

Instead of fighting it, we embrace this evolving process by:

* Always having working software to maximize learning
* Reassessing priorities often
* Having the team communicate on a daily basis

To this end, engaged clients:

* Are available for frequent communication (daily meetings)
* Understand the purpose of the software being built
* Have a stake in the success of the project

What to Expect
--------------

The product owner meets with the development team on a daily basis. We often
call these meetings "Stand Ups", a term from Agile Software Development
where the team stands in a circle for a quick discussion.  Because people aren't
sitting down, these meetings tend to be quick and only cover day-to-day work.

On a weekly basis we'll have a check-in meeting where we discuss bigger picture
items, talk about the process, and reset priorities for work.
