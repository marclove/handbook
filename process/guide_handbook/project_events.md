# Project Events

The guide needs to be aware of critical events in a project, and needs to be the first point of contact for these events. A number of tools have been built into the Gaslight Team app to help automate these processes.

## Onboarding a Project

Onboarding a project successfully requires that we educate the client about how Gaslight projects are run, and what makes them successful. We've broken our onboarding process into 5 different sections that are designed to be given to a client over a week's period.

### Onboarding Topics

1. Gaslight Team - Monday

  * Names and roles of all team members
  * Team email alias
  * Conference number
  * Github and Heroku usernames

2. (Tuesday)

3. (Wednesday)

4. (Thursday)

5. (Friday)


## Starting an Engagement

Hopefully, the start of engagement (a later round of work on a project) does not require the same level of orientation. However, there's still information we need to communicate to the client. It's also good to refresh their memory of how projects are run. We've condensed the weekly orientation information into a single email.

## Team Member Outages/Vacation

Each Monday, the guide will receive an email with the time off requests starting 2 weeks out. This information should be given to the client in verbal and written form with 2 weeks notice (TODO: 1 week instead?). We  give the names and information of the floating team member who is covering on the project.

## Pair Rotation

Similarly, we communicate, with sufficient notice, changes to the project team that we make for pair rotation purposes. The tool for the guide that facilitates this information has not yet been built.

## Ending an Engagement

The upcoming end of the engagement is important for the client and the team. It serves as a reminder that we need to focus carefully during the last few weeks of a project. It also is an opportunity to talk about extending the engagement, or scheduling the next period of work. An email notification sent to the guide will soon be built that provides notice of this date 2 weeks out.
